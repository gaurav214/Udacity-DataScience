**Summary of the Results**

In this project, we took a look at stock price data of some companies over a 3 year time period to understand stock price fluctuations and answered some question which will help a day trader to make better day trading strategies.
We observed how Amazon , Google and Microsoft keep on increasing their technological performance and which resulted in higher stock prices than ever before. Also, we noticed that Netflix seems to be the most riskiest stock with a gradually increasing but very fluctuating graph(high standard deviation) and Adobe with the most stable growth and least standard deviation.
